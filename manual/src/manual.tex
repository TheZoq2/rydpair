    \section{Safety and Warranty information}
    Please read through and understand the following contents before using your
    new \carbrand{\textregistered} \carmodel{\texttrademark}.
    \carbrand{\textregistered} is not responsible for any physical, emotional,
    material, spectral or other damages to any driver, passenger, mechanic,
    pedestrian, student or other living or undead entity.

    Should injury occur, the built in phone can be used to dial emergency services,
    however additional charges may be incurred for the duration of the call.

    \subsection{Seatbelts}

    Before starting the vehicle, all passengers should wear their respective
    seatbelts\footnote{Sold separately}. To use the seatbelts, first ensure
    that the seatbelts are attached properly by tugging on them firmly. Then
    move the metal part attached to the belt to the red and black thingy. The
    metal thingy should attach to the red thingy with an audible click. If the
    audible click is not audible\footnote{this manual is sponsored by. Go to
    audible.com/\carbrand{} for a free audio book}, your seatbelts may not be
    installed properly by refering to the installation manual for the
    seatbelts.
